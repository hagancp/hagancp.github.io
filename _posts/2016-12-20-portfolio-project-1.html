      As cities continue to grow in populate, transportation starts to become a <b>major</b> issue.
      City dwellers don't necessarily need cars, but typically aren't included to commute by walk.

        <b>Where are we headed?</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Based on trend research and analytics, cities are becoming <b>more bike accessible</b> as demand for city-jobs and alternate fuel sources increase.
        <br/>
        Through surveying around 75 cyclists and non-cyclists locally and around the world, we discovered that the main driving factors for choosing to commute by bicycle are <b>distance</b>, <b>storage limitations</b>, and <b>well-being</b>.

      <b>Seasoned cyclists will commute by bike, rain or shine.</b> But <i>new commuters are more geared towards the e-bike realm to tackle the issue of distance.</i>
      <br/>
      However, current electric bike offerings are either very limited in flexibility or lack appeal.
      <br/>

      <br/>
      In an attempt to build a viable solution to <b>hardcore cyclists and newbies alike</b>, we have an opportunity that lies in a <b>hybrid solution</b> that keeps the appeal to a traditional bicycle while offering electrical-assist for long commutes.

      Shibusa was the result of a nine-week study with good friends <a href="http://joshadycus.com" target="_blank">Joshua Dycus</a> and Courtney Gruber. Many thanks to Professor Kevin Shankwiler for being an all-around awesome mentor as well as SRAM for graciously sponsoring the project.
